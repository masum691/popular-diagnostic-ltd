A colonoscopy is a medical examination that identifies abnormalities in the large intestine and rectum.It involves the use of a long flexible tube (called the colonoscope) which consists of a video camera at the tip. It also has a hollow channel through which small flexible instruments can be passed. This allows the doctor to view the insides of the colon and treat any abnormalities that are detected.How Is It Performed?  First, the patient is given medication through an intravenous (IV) needle to induce drowsiness and sedation. While the patient is lying on their side, the doctor performs the colonoscopy by inserting a long, flexible tubular instrument into the colon.This tube consists of a light and video camera at its tip. This camera sends real-time footage to an external monitor so that the doctor can observe the insides for any abnormalities. The instrument is inserted through the rectum and goes all the way to the other end of the large intestine.",
