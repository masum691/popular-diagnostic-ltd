This is a healthcare-related diagnostic website. It has been a great experience creating this website. 
Sometimes errors would come. When I corrected the bugs, I gained a lot of knowledge.


**About This Website-**

- I have used 5 pages on this website. The pages are Home, Services, Our Doctors, About Us, Contact.

- On the home page, I used a slider. There are 6 service cards, plus a comfort section. There is a hover effect on the cards. By clicking on the see more button, the card details are displayed in another route.

- There are different types of services on the Services page. When you click on the see more button, you are taken to another route where the card details are displayed.

- Detailed information about popular diagnostics Ltd can be found on the About Us page.

- There is a contact form on the contact us page. I have used 2 cards, one for head office and the other for a branch office, each with the office address.

- The navigation bar and footer will display all pages.

- I have used a route not found. When the user enters the wrong link, it will show "Not Found".

- Login and register has been used on the website. Users are able to log in and register.

- The service buttons have been routed privately. When users click on the button, if they are not logged in, they will be taken to the login page.
